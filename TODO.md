## Completed Tasks

- [x] Add multer configuration in userController.js for profile photo uploads
- [x] Implement updateProfile method in userController.js
- [x] Implement changePassword method in userController.js
- [x] Update User model to include photo_profil in createTable, update, and findById methods

- [x] Update Profile.jsx to construct full image URL for display
- [x] Add static file serving in server.js for uploads directory
- [x] Alter database table to add photo_profil column
- [x] Fix User.update method to handle partial updates (only update provided fields)
- [x] Update User.findAll to include photo_profil in SELECT query
- [x] Test server startup

## Key Fixes Made
- **User.update method**: Changed from requiring all fields to only updating provided fields, preventing NULL overwrites
- **Database queries**: Added photo_profil to all relevant SELECT queries
- **Partial updates**: Profile updates now only modify telephone and photo_profil, password changes only modify password

## Summary of Changes
- Backend now supports profile photo uploads with multer
- Users can update their telephone number and profile photo via PUT /api/users/profile
- Users can change their password via PUT /api/users/profile/password
- Profile photos are stored in uploads/profiles/ directory
- Static file serving added for /uploads route
- Database schema updated to include photo_profil column
- Frontend updated to display profile images with full URL

## Testing Required
- Test profile photo upload functionality
- Test telephone number update
- Test password change functionality
- Verify image display in profile page
- Check error handling for invalid file types and sizes
- Test login redirection based on user role

## Additional Fixes Made
- **Login redirection**: Updated Login.jsx to redirect users to appropriate dashboard based on their role (admin -> /admin/dashboard, users -> /user/dashboard)
- **AuthContext**: Added updateUser function to allow profile updates to reflect in the UI immediately

The profile update feature should now work correctly for users to modify their profile photo, telephone number, and password. Login now properly redirects users based on their role.
